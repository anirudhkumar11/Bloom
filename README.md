SoulBloom üåø
Nurture your mind. Watch your soul bloom.

SoulBloom is a deeply personal and beautifully designed digital sanctuary that empowers individuals to navigate the complexities of their emotional landscape. It transforms the practice of mental wellness from a clinical chore into an inspiring and accessible journey of self-discovery, resilience, and guided support. This project is a fully functional web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring AI-powered chat, interactive mindfulness exercises, and a serene 3D environment.

‚ú® Core Features
SoulBloom is designed to be a companion for personal growth, offering a suite of tools to support mental well-being:

‚ù§Ô∏è Daily Check-in: A gentle, frictionless ritual to build self-awareness. Users can log their mood daily using expressive "Mood Petals," creating a moment of pause and reflection.

‚ú® Aura, Your AI Guide: A 24/7 conversational AI companion powered by the Google Gemini API. Aura provides an empathetic, non-judgmental space for users to talk through their feelings and can guide them through evidence-based mindfulness techniques. It includes a critical safety protocol to provide resources in crisis situations.

üåø Mindful Moments: A collection of interactive, guided exercises designed to help users find their center. This includes a Body Scan Meditation, a Gratitude Journal, and a visual Box Breathing exercise.

ü™¥ The Echo Garden: A truly safe and anonymous peer support space. Users can "plant a seed" (a post) to share their thoughts and "water" others' posts to show support, with a one-water-per-post rule to make each interaction meaningful.

üêæ 3D Forest Walk: An immersive, procedurally generated 3D forest where users can take a mindful walk. It features a walking character, an endless path, and a step counter to encourage gentle, mindful movement.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
This application is built from the ground up using fundamental web technologies, demonstrating a blend of elegant front-end design and powerful API integration.

Front-End: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and modern JavaScript (ES6+).

3D Graphics: Three.js for the immersive "Forest Walk" experience.

Artificial Intelligence: The Google Gemini API for the conversational AI, "Aura."

Design Philosophy: Inspired by the clean, user-centric principles on Mobbin, with a focus on creating a calming, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing user experience.
